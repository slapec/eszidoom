# eszidoom
eszioom is an old Doom3 map based on my secondary school.

# Try
The simple but dirty method:
1. Copy each directory (`guis, maps, materials, textures`) in your `Doom 3/base` directory.
2. Run the game, open the console (`CTRL+ALT+0`) and type: `map eszidoom`
3. ????
4. PROFIT!

# Build
1. Just pack the directories described in step 2 above in one single `.zip` file
2. Change file extension from `.zip` to `.pk4`
3. Put the file in your `Doom 3/base` directory.
4. Run the game, open the console and type: `map eszidoom`
5. \o/

# Development state
The project in this state is finished since 2008 but the map itself is not. Feel free to do anything
and send me a note if you are using it or someting.

# Assets
All textures are created by me so the same license (MIT) is applied on them.
